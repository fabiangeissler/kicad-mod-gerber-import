# kicad-mod-gerber-import
Kicad Module (Footprint) gerber data import tool.

## What it is meant for
The purpose of this script is to create Kicad footprints from gerber structures generated by EM-simulation tools for RF PCB layouts. The simple GUI makes it easy to add ports to the structure and creates a ready to use footprint which nets can be assigned to.

Although it might work, the intention never was to import whole PCBs.

## Progress
Until now only the import of gerber files with polygon regions is implemented. All other gerber primitives will not be converted.

## How to use
* Start the script. 
* Open the gerber file.
* Click on the edges you wish to assign pads to. A pad is quadratic in shape and as long as the edge. Polygons without a pad will be converted to unconnected copper polygons (e.g. for filter structures). The first pad is converted to a custom shape that contains the polygon. All further pads on the same polygon have the same pad number but are separate rectangular pads.
* Save the kicad_mod file
